        text: "MicroPasts is built upon the Neighbor.ly project, which was developed as a fundraising toolkit to help communities pay for the things they truly care about. Simply put, we connect underfunded civic projects to alternative sources of funding. With our tools at their disposal, individuals, corporations and foundations all contribute to build stronger, healthier & smarter communities."

        text: "The more effort you put into your campaign, the better the results you'll see. Take a look through our best practices in order to maximize your return and remember, it's not just about the money. While running a MicroPasts campaign, Â you're raising awareness, building a support base, establishing partnerships and engaging a national community of people just like you."
      costs:
        title: "Low & Equitable Fees"
        text: "When we set out to change the way civic projects were financed, we knew we had to make this toolset available to every community. That's why MicroPasts takes a low 1% fee for successfully funded projects and charges nothing upfront. That's it. Payment fees associated with each transaction are paid for directly by the contributor."
